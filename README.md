# Climate Change Belief Sentiment Analysis from Tweets

Predict an individualâ€™s belief in climate change based on historical tweet data & provide insights into the various climate change sentiment classes.

Climate change has long been acknowledged by the scientific community as a critical issue facing mankind. However, even with scientific consensus around Climate Change, public opinion on the subject may vary.

The goal of this challenge is to build a Classification Machine Learning model that will determine whether a person believes in Climate Change using tweet data. This project also provides insights of public opinion of Climate Change & consumer sentiment to companies looking to market their new or improved products or services to consumers, in response to CER.

This sentiment classification model identifies these potential customers and could be used any business or organisation committed to carbon neutrality & wanting to inform marketing strategies. This includes, but is not limited to companies in the retail, automotive, government, agriculture & food, pharmaceutical spheres. The model could also be used by sectors in government wanting to identify the various belief sentiments in order to better direct environmental awareness and education campaigns in alignment with their legislative directives and climate change response plans.
